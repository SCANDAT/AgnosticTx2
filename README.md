# AgnosticTx2
This is an agnostic study of possible transfusion effects with Swedish-US data. Specifically we investigate how different factors in the donor-donation-component continuum affect changes in laboratory parameters among transfused patients. In total, we include data on >100,000 transfused patients, considering the effect of 10-15 different donor-donation-component characteristics on 50 different laboratory markers.

The analyses are simplistic, using linear mixed effects models (with or without log transformation) to study associations, which are then subject to FDR adjustment and first internal and then external validation using data from the US.
